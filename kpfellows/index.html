		<p>By studying computer science, I am able to understand one more facet of the world and the way it is intended to work. Computer science is the technology and study of really the future rather than the present because it brings problem-solving skills and unites them with the technology we have today in order to create the technology of tomorrow.</p>

		<p>The fact that today's knowledge and today's technology can make a difference in tomorrow, that our world is not doomed, that we can find solutions to the rising issues caused by climate change or the spread of misinformation, and that technology can not only be used in creating the solution, but it can be used in the solution and used as the method to find the solution.</p>

		<p>We can analyze more data than ever before with powerful computers and machine learning: what's next for humanity? We've gone to the moon with less memory than is contained in many keyboards today, and yet technical limitations have never stopped humanity from dreaming. Dreamers can make a difference in the world - engineering and computer science help to make such a difference as people come together and collaborate with university educations and congregate at universities in order to find common ground where they can work together on the same projects that they are passionate about and truly believe in.</p>
